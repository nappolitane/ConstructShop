# Construct Shop

This repository contains a project for one of my cyber security master's courses. This is a PHP/MYSQL web application that i implemented, which contains 5 vulnerabilities placed intentionally by me and which had to be found by other colleagues (feel free to test it and check if i let anything else slip through). It was a great project and i decided to translate it in English and upload it to my online github portfolio.
